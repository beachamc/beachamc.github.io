My name is Cameron Beacham and I am a Computer Science major at the College of Charleston. Currently, I am in my final semester of my Senior year. This blog was created for CSCI 462 as a means to blog my thoughts about current events in the computer science industry as well as articles I may read over the semester. 

This blog was created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using Github pages.
