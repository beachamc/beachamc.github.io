The list of meetup groups is rather small and it doesn't seem as though any of them are incredibly active. I search around on the web and wasn't able to find any groups meeting before April 7th or even meeting any time soon. I joined a group called [CharlestonJS](http://www.meetup.com/CharlestonJS/) but they haven't scheduled their next meetup and its been a few months since they've last met up. I like the idea of meeting up with a group that has the same interests as I do however, this website doesn't seem to be as active as it would need to be for the purposes in this class. Regardless of whether they meet up before I would need them to for this assignment I still think I will go to the meeting just because I think it is interesting and I enjoy all the different things that JS can do.
