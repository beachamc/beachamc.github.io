The first article I looked into was called [Good Design Matters](http://opensource.com/life/15/2/good-design-matters-open-source-projects). This article hit home with me because I have always valued design in all of my projects. With any good program, a horrible design could ruin the usability even if the program itself was extremely well designed programatically. The article outlines the process that a software project goes through in order to redesign and create a better interface for the users. The author mentions that since they are a business application there is typically less emphasis on the design aspect of it. The members of the project hired a professional designer to simplify the interface. They demonstrated that employing a good design isn't time consuming or expensive but can have a large payout in the end. The results that they achieved showed a lot of traction for their project with the revamped design.

The second article talks about [Rebranding Open Source](http://opensource.com/life/14/10/community-software-and-future-foss). The reason that the author gives for rebranding open source is that businesses can sometimes jump to the conclusion that because open source is free that it is less secure and less reliable. However, this does not have to be the case. The authors claim was that by rebranding open source for businesses it can gain more traction in the market share and begin to grow even more. The thing with any software is that the more users it has, the more it can grow as software because of the extensive use. Additionally, the businesses would be able to benefit from this as well. The software, being open source could be customized to the businesses needs as well as bringing down the costs significantly. The author has a really good point that businesses can really benefit from open source and it is mostly the stigma against it that is holding them back.

Both of these articles discuss a rebranding of sorts. They both take the idea of changing the perception of their product that will benefit everyone who uses it. The developers gain a larger market share and the users benefit from the simplicity of design or from the custom features that they can now take advantage of.
