This report was probably our biggest struggle as a team because we were not able to meet up in person. However, we were able to use the previous research we had done in class and used email to pull everything together. With that being said, our project is going very well. We orginally found that bugs were a bit difficult to find because they were fixed so quickly. However, a major opportunity for us would be adding to the documentation and then later, actually implementing a feature. We've outlined a few possible documentation fixes that we could do to get started and then after that a couple different features that we could pick from.

The first documentation bug is actually an issue of installing from source. The current documentation seems to be usable but the suggested fix seems a lot more clear. The current documenation uses PIP to install mopidy rather than using a ```python install setup.py```. This would be a pretty easy fix and one of the lead developers said they would be open to the contribution.

There was also a doc request on updating the documentation on the getters and setters. Currently the documentation is pretty outdated and only lists the attributes rather than their updated methods for getting and setting these attributes. This also ties in with depricating some of the original classes and methods that are from early versions in the documentation. 

Our team has pretty much decided we would like to take on the task of implementing a feature. Our major idea would be to implement Pandora support however, adding dynamic playlists needs to be implemented first. I think that our team will more than likely attempt to implement this feature of dynamic playlists which would be a major task. However, I think that we have a team capable of pulling it off.
