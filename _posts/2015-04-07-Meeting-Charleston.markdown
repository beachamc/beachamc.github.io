With my work schedule it makes it pretty tough to get to a meetup when I'm scheduled off. However, I am going to POSSCON on Wednesday and there will be several workshops that I will attend that can take the place of this meeting. I am planning to attend the "Going further with git" and "Angular JS" workshops that day and will try to make connections after the workshops. I will add more to this blog after attending these workshops.

This chapter talks about User Support. Most of the topics in this chapter seemed pretty obvious to me and I really think that the chapter could even be replaced by mentioning aspects of User Support throughout the book. However, there were some good takeaways like the principles of good technical writing and even the bit that talks about knowing your audience. Application developers are lucky to have a good idea ahead of time as to the general knowledge level of their audience and I think that most people would keep that in mind.
