With my work schedule it makes it pretty tough to get to a meetup when I'm scheduled off. However, I am going to POSSCON on Wednesday and there will be several workshops that I will attend that can take the place of this meeting. I am planning to attend the "Going further with git" and "Angular JS" workshops that day and will try to make connections after the workshops. I will add more to this blog after attending these workshops.

Update:
After attending POSSCON I can say that I definitely learned a lot. I went to both the Angular JS workshop and Going further with Git which were very well taught. The first one that I attended was the going further with Git which started at a lower level than I was expecting with the title being "going further with Git" but I still got a lot out of it. I learned about ATOM.io which after some tinkering has become one of my text editors of choice and learned about some features of Git that can help with project management. Additionally, I was able to talk to Lee Faus about his work at Github and it seems like an amazing company to work for. I asked him if he had any advice on breaking into the industry and his response was simply to apply at as many places as you can. I have since taken this to heart and have gotten great response from it. Next, I attended the Angular JS workshop which was what I was looking forward to the most out of POSSCON. The workshop didn't dissappoint--except the fact that it was so packed that a few of us literally had to sit on the floor. I learned how to create a simple web app that tracks goals and has search capabililies but the most important thing I learned was his workflow and how he dealt with problems when they arose. I didn't get to talk to him as much as I wanted to at the end because there were so many people but I did stir up some great conversation about his favorite things in Javascript. It was definitely an opportunity that I am glad to have been given and I look forward to future events like this.

This chapter talks about User Support. Most of the topics in this chapter seemed pretty obvious to me and I really think that the chapter could even be replaced by mentioning aspects of User Support throughout the book. However, there were some good takeaways like the principles of good technical writing and even the bit that talks about knowing your audience. Application developers are lucky to have a good idea ahead of time as to the general knowledge level of their audience and I think that most people would keep that in mind.
