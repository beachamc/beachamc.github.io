The SSM Poster Session was a really great opportunity to not only get to show off the work our team has done, but also to see all the work being done from other areas of the school. I found the data mining posters extremely interesting and apparently so did the judges because two of them won awards. I also, enjoyed getting to see other classmates posters and learn about their projects since many of my friends are in the other section of 462 and I haven't gotten to learn much about what they were doing. 

Moreover, I walked around and looked at other posters from different schools of science. I started out in the Biology department; however, after an in depth explaination about neural patterns and behaviors I quickly moved on to something more in my range of understanding. I enjoyed the geology and marine science areas and was able to grasp their concepts far easier than the biology posters.

I was really shocked at the number of people who seemed genuinely interested in our poster and what we had to say. I was actually able to stay the whole time and got to talk to several people about what we had done so far. At the beginning, I found myself going to far in detail about what we did but as time progressed I found a knack for figuring out when people were understanding what I was explaining and for those who weren't too tech-saavy I gave more of an overview of what we accomplished. It went by a lot faster than I expected it to but I think that everyone there had a pretty good time. I was actually pleasantly surprised of the amount of people there and think that the SSM did a great job with it this year.
