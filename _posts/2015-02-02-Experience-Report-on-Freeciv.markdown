Open source projects can have a ton of problems. Considering the fact that they are usually started by a single person or group that would then spread out to multiple contributers it is not surprising. This is largely in part because the developers computers have been set up specifically for the development of this project that they created and not for your computer. Additionally, if a project hasn't been updated in a while it could cause further issues with compatibility.

For this assignment I worked through the freeciv building and installing from source code. There were a few bugs at first but mostly it went alright. My main issue was that the repolist from yum which it recommends to install gcc was showing 0 and I couldn't get it to update. However, I finally was able to install gcc and follow the remaining instructions with little problem. 

With projects like this I find that there is a steep learning curve with the initial setup and getting everything running, however, after that the process gets a lot easier and its easier contributing from then on out. All in all this assignment was very similar to building other open source projects that I have worked on in the past.
