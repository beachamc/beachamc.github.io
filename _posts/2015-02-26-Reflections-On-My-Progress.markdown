At this point I am slightly concerned about the flow of issues through Mopidy. When we looked at the program at first there seemed like a lot of issues, however, that was because we were just seeing them for the first time. The number of new bugs reported has seemingly dropped to maybe one or two bugs every few days. While this is still a decent number, the bugs posted are usually people having issues getting something to work and not really bugs. I put in an issue for the lack of support for contributing on OSX and the ticket so far has gone unnoticed. I have already forked and made the changes and if the developer would accept it I could already create the pull request for the necessisary changes. I am also currently looking for other bugs that seem to be within my ability however, the ones that get posted are either larger features or very complicated bugs.

As a team, I think we are all still trying to figure out the code base and learn exactly how the software works. Now that I have done some digging in the documentation I have a better handle on how the program works. However, it is still a complex program and has things that I don't yet understand. Hopefully, we can work as a team to get more familiar with the software and work to create the feature we aimed to create.
