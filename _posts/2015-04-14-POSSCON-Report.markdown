The journey to POSSCON unfortunately took a little bit longer than I expected and I arrived about 20 minutes late. However, I was able to attend both workshops that I planned on attending and got to talk to two of the 3 people I had planned on talking to. 

The first was Semmy Purewal who I had spoken with back at the Alumni Symposium but not as much as I had wanted to. So, he was the person I wanted to make sure I got to speak with the most. I talked to him about Netflix and his journey that got him there and asked him if he thought it was worth moving to other areas for a more diverse range of options. His reply was a resounding yes. He told me that he had to move around quite a bit throughout his career and that it make him a much more rounded person. He said that typically, certain areas tend to focus on certain languages, development strategies, etc. and that it was worth it to him to get to see all the different things people did. 

Second, was supposed to be Nic Rosenthal of Epic Labs, however, I was unable to track him down and opted to go with Tom Wilson instead. I took his workshop on Angular JS and really enjoyed it. I didn't get as much time to talk to him as I would of liked but I asked him a few questions about Javascript and listened to some conversations he was having with other people there. He mostly spoke on the rise of popularity in Javascript and the power that the language has with such little input from the developer. Overall, it was a really interested talk and definitely my favorite part of POSSCON.

Finally, I got to talk to Lee Faus shortly after his Git workshop. I talked to him about how to go from college into the computer science industry and he told me the best way to get a job somewhere was to apply at as many places as I could find. I have since taken this to heart and any place that looks remotely interesting to me I apply at. This way I have as many options as possible available to me when I graduate. 

POSSCON was a really great experience, not only did I get to talk to the presenters who were experts in their fields, but I also got to meet new people who were attending POSSCON and talk to them about their backgrounds in computer science. I think that this is a *must* for anyone who enjoys computer science. Hopefully, we can convince them to come back to Charleston next time!
