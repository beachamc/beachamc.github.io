Open source projects are a great way to get into developing on projects of a larger scale. However, there are literally thousands of open source projects out there. I researched a few projects that interested me and give descriptions of each of them below. They are listed in order of preference:

First is an open source python web crawler called [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) (Here is a [link](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) to their Github). Scrapy is really interesting to me because it allows you to define patterns for elements on a page and then it will crawl a given website or list of websites and mine the information that you need. This could be really useful in a data mining application or even to aggregate data for a website that brings together information from multiple sources. Scrapy is written almost entirely in Python and would be a great option for us since everyone seems to be very comfortable with Python. Second, there is a lot of traffic on their [Github](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) and they are good about documenting issues that needs to be fixed as well as labeling their diffuculty to fix. Even more, Scrapy seems like an interesting framework and even if we don't decide to use it for our project, I've still starred it on Github and will definitly take a look at it in the future.

Next, is a blogging platform called [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) (Here is a [link](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) to their Github). Ghost is written in JavaScript so the language itself will be pretty easy to pick up for those of us who are less familiar with it. What's more is that Ghost has actually gotten a lot of traction in the past year and their [Github](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) is very active. I tend to gravitate towards web-based projects for some reason so this was an obvious choice when I discovered it on Github. One of the things that I looked at when deciding on projects was how polished the application looked and Ghost is by far the most polished out of the 3 that I picked and the well written documentation will make it a strong candidate.

Finally, there is [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (Here is a [link](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) to their Github). I can't say enough about this JavaScript task runner. I have used this in the past for automating web development and it cuts out a great deal of time. It is written in JavaScript and would definitely be easy to get into. It has several sub-projects, but the one I would like to work on would be the main branch. The documentation for Grunt is amazing. I have used it in the past and it was really easy to figure out and they have an extremely active community that will post replies to Stack Overflow with the tag Gruntjs and they have an IRC dedicated to community support. This project is definitely the most mature of the 3 so it is likely that the bugs will be minimal or difficult to fix.

Of the three of these I think that Scrapy is my top choice because I am strongest with Python and would like to dive in. It also interests me the most out of all three. I haven't looked to see which bugs seemed plausible to fix but regardless it definitely seems very doable.
