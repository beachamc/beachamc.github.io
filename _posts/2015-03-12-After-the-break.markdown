We've made some great progress so far as a team, but now our focus needs to be on preparing for the final presentation and creating the poster. We've decided to tackle at least one more bug which Michael and Ron are focusing on while Laura and I work on the poster/powerpoint. Our team communication is very good and everyone is always quick to reply back to group emails about questions with code, or meetup times.
For the bug, it deals with a limitation of MPD clients. Typically, MPD clients don't allow over 10,000 songs to be in a single playlist. There are some clients that allow for more but 10,000 is pretty standard. Since Mopidy is simply a server that allows MPD clients to access music from different sources, Mopidy also shares this limitation. However, this is not handled gracefully in Mopidy and there is no user setting to actually change it if someone is using an MPD client that allows for more. This is our current understanding of the bug and we are currently looking at adding in a setting that allows the max song count to be configurable. 
For the poster, we are coming along a little bit slower. We've decided to use Photoshop to create it since it gives a lot more control over how it looks and Laura and I are both comfortable using it. So as for now, we are gathering the information that will be on the poster and then we will look at the design and work on it collaborative across the whole team.
