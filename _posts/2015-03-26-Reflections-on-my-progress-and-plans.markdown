Database knowledge is incredibly important no matter what field you go into. Mostly, because they are an extremely efficient way to store data and pretty much anything that uses persistent storage uses them. I have found that a lot of platforms such as .NET or Java EE tend to lessen the need for specific knowledge about databases. However, the necessity for having a basic working knowledge of how databases work is critical in my opinion. An example would be the CRUD principles (create, read, update, delete). These provide insight on the functionality of a database and show what it can and can't do. The other thing that is important to know is the security of databases. I think that the author of the book does a good job in describing this. 

> A secure database is one that accomplishes all of the following goals:
>
> * It prevents unauthorized or accidental disclosure, alteration, or destruc- tion of data.
* It prevents unauthorized or accidental access to data considered conÙè∞Ö- dential to the organization or individual who owns the data.
* It ensures data integrity, so that the data stored in the database are always valid and accurate. 

As for team progress, we've continued to make good progress and even got a video interview recorded that is currently being edited. Michael and Ron are continuing to work on their bug concerning the max song count being 10,000.
