Semmy Purewal - Netflix
Nic Rosental - Epic Labs
Lee Faus - Github

I am planning to go to day two (Wednesday) of POSSCON and have a few people I'm definitely looking forward to meeting. First is Semmy Purewal from Netflix because I didn't get to talk to him as much as I would have liked to at the CS Symposium and I am a huge fan of Javascript of which he is a major proponent. Next, is James Schweitzer of IBM. Whats really cool about James is that he contributed to the creation of Watson, the AI Jeopardy contestant. He has two decades of experience and even though I don't see myself going to IBM I think he would have some really good insight on job hunting and getting started in the computer science industry. Lastly is Lee Faus from Github. I'm super excited to meet Lee because Github is a major company that so many people use. I want to ask him about the culture at Github and how he got where he was because I would eventually like to work for one of the major tech companies like Github. I am also planning to attend a few of the workshops on Wednesday with Github and Angular JS so I will get even more knowledge about these speakers.

I am excited to attend POSSCON and hope to gain a lot from the experience. This will be my first time attending something like this as I was not able to go to StartUp Weekend or any other computer science conferences. I will only be able to attend on Wednesday but I hope to learn a lot during the workshops I plan to take.
