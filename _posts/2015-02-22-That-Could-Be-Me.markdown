I thought that the 2015 computer science symposium was very good on Tuesday. However, I would have liked to have had a better seating system as I had to leave my class early to get there and I ended up getting there right as it was starting so there were few seats left. The presentations were pretty good, a bit different from what I was expecting though. I was expecting more of them selling us on their companies and instead they opted to give advice that could be used for any company. That was something that I really liked because there was such a diverse group of panelists that their advice pretty much covered all the bases. I especially liked the advice that they gave about preparing for obvious questions like "Why choose our company?" or "Why did you get into Computer Science". There were a few no brainer tips like make sure your resume looks nice and is updated and to dress up for interviews, but they said they had issues with people not doing those things so I guess it was good that they mentioned it.

For the actual presentations themselves there seemed to be a few panelists who dominated the discussion and others who kind of just sat there. I would have liked it a bit more if maybe there were 4-5 different tables with a different person at each and you could go around and ask each of them questions individually. The networking for me was the most important part since I am going to be graduating this May and I currently don't have any options for when I graduate. I had spoken with Mike from Blackbaud a while back and he said that there would be more positions opening up in February so I talked to him about that and he actually was able to set me up with an interview. I spoke with a few other panelists but Blackbaud seemed to be the most promising. I've since done the interview and will see what comes of it.
